    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large free-range eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>toast to serve</li>          
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a medium sized saucepan with water and bring to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Make sure your eggs aren't fridge cold. By having the eggs at room temperature, it will be less of a shock for the egg reaching the hot water and therefore less likely to crack. You can also use an egg pricker to make a very small hole in each egg before boiling, which will also reduce the chances of it cracking in the heat. Slowly lower the eggs into the water using a spoon.</li>
        <li>Set your timer for 4-5 mins for runny/dippy eggs to serve with soldiers, or 6-7 mins for soft-boiled eggs for a salad. If serving in a salad, plunge the eggs into a bowl of cold water as soon as the timer goes off - this will stop them cooking and cool the shells quickly for peeling.</li>
    </ol>
